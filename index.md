## Introduction

Our mission is to deliver working software to our customers in a changing world. We understand the need for change and for us to 
to respond to that change to help our customers realise their vision. To achieve this we value:

* Individual and interactions
* Customer collaboration
* Maintainable software
* Adaptable architecture

And should be careful not to:

* Work in silos
* Over engineer 
* Be a barrier for change

### Standards and best practices

Standards allow teams to produce consistent work. When standards are followed developers can pick up each others work easily and 
understand it more readily. Through working to common conventions tasks can be completed predictably and rapidly.
