## Introduction

Our mission is to deliver working software to our customers. We understand the need 
for change and for us to be able respond to that change to help our customers realise 
their vision. 

To achieve this we value:

* Collaboration between individuals and with customers
* Code that is readable, maintainable, and adaptive to change
* Continuous attention to technical excellence

And should be careful not to:

* Work in silos
* Over engineer 
* Be a barrier for change

### Standards and best practices

Standards allow teams to produce consistent work. When standards are followed developers can pick up each others work easily and 
understand it more readily. Through working to common conventions tasks can be completed predictably and rapidly.
