## Introduction

This document is intended as a succinct guide for the Creative Jar development team, 
encouraging adherence to the SOLID design principles, particularly in the context of 
a typical piece of software development work undertaken at Creative Jar.


A reminder of the SOLID principles:

* S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* O - Open Closed Principle (OCP)
* L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
* I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
* D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
